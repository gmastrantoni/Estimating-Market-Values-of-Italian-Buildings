# Estimating Asset Market Values of Italy
 Real-estate's market values estimation based on official data retrieved from the OMI database provided by the Italian Revenue Agency (Agenzia delle Entrate) and combined with building footprints from DBSN database.

## Project Overview
 
 This repository exploits the OMI national-scale open access database (which stands for Osservatorio Mercato Immobiliare – real estate market observatory), togheter with the DBSN database containing territorial information including buildings footprints and categories.
 The OMI database is managed and updated every six months by the National Revenue Agency under the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance. The OMI dataset encompasses comprehensive information regarding the minimum and maximum market values for various building typologies, expressed in euros per square metre. These data are aggregated at the municipality level and further stratified into smaller subdivisions, known as ‘OMI zones’, within the respective municipality.
 Categories of use from the DBSN database are linked to typologies from OMI zones, and the respective economic values were associated according to the location and type of buildings.
